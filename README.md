# SJ-Price-Algorithm

This notebook creates a demand based variable price algorithm for Saint James hostel with the following tunable parameters: 

1) elasticity,
2) number of additional days in the future to take into account,
3) time penalty (the degree to which the importance of each additional day declines),
4) weekend multiplier,
5) floor ratio, and
6) base price.

The algorithm is explained algebraically and a set of simulations is run to tune the parameters.
